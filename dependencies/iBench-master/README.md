# iBench

iBench is a suite of contentious microbenchmarks. Each microbenchmark targets a different shared resource in a multi-core chip (processing cores, cache capacity, main memory bandwidth) and has tunable intensity. iBench was originally written to evaluate the [Paragon cluster scheduler](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2451125), but has since been considerably altered. You can find more details about iBench in our [IISWC paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6704667/) ([PDF](http://csl.stanford.edu/~christos/publications/2013.ibench.iiswc.pdf)).
